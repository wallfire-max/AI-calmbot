# AI-calmbot
This Python script implements CalmBot, a lightweight command-line chatbot designed to provide simple emotional support, calming prompts, and grounding exercises. It operates entirely offline and uses no external libraries. Instead, it relies on basic text processing, keyword detection, and predefined responses to simulate a supportive conversation.
